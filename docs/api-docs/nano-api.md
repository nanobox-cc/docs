# Interactive API

The Nanobox interactive API covers a subset of the full Nano RPC specification. For the complete documentation 
head over to the [Nano RPC protocol page](https://docs.nano.org/commands/rpc-protocol/).

Our goal is to cover the most used operations in order to interact with the Nano network.
