# Getting started

This section will cover a basic setup of a simple client app
that talks to the Nano network over the Nanobox gateway. The setup is currently described
in Javascript, but any language will do. In the future the guide will cover integration guides 
for different types of programming languages.

The introduction will cover the following topics:

1. Authenticating with Nanobox API
2. Fetching the account information for a given Nano address
