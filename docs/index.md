# Welcome

This is the documentation hub for [Nanobox](https://nanobox.cc). It's a living document on how to interact with the API. 
[Open an issue](https://github.com/nanobox-cc/docs/issues) if you have any questions or feedback!

Make sure to check out the official documentation at [docs.nano.org](https://docs.nano.org/). The official documentation covers 
everything around the base protocol, details when interacting with the node and much more!

The Nanobox API documentation aims to document the most practical use cases for integrating with the Nano network. This being
getting info from the network and moving Nano from one account to the other.

## Getting access

In order to get  API token access to the closed beta email us at contact@nanobox.cc or head over to the
[main page](https://nanobox.cc) for more information.

If you want to play around with the network and don't have any requirements for uptime/PoW, there's an excellent
list of free to use Node APIs at [somenano.com](https://publicnodes.somenano.com/).
