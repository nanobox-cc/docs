# Welcome

This is the documentation hub for [Nanobox](https://nanobox.cc)! Currently work in progress on how to interact with the API. 
Open an issue if you have any questions or feedback!

Make sure to check out the official documentation at [docs.nano.org](https://docs.nano.org/). The official documentation covers 
everything around the base protocol, details when interacting with the node and much more!

The Nanobox API documentation aims to document the most practical use cases for when integrating with the node. This being
getting info from the network and moving Nano from one account to the other.
